    <p><b>Two general theories exist on the origins of yoga. The linear model holds that yoga originated in the Vedic
            period, as reflected in the Vedic textual corpus, and influenced Buddhism; according to author Edward
            Fitzpatrick Crangle, this model is mainly supported by Hindu scholars. According to the synthesis model,
            yoga is a synthesis of non-Vedic and Vedic elements; this model is favoured in Western scholarship.

            Yoga is first mentioned in the Rigveda, and is referred to in a number of the Upanishads. The first known
            appearance of the word "yoga" with the same meaning as the modern term is in the Katha Upanishad, which was
            probably composed between the fifth and third centuries BCE. Yoga continued to develop as a systematic study
            and practice during the fifth and sixth centuries BCE in ancient India's ascetic and Śramaṇa movements. The
            most comprehensive text on Yoga, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, date to the early centuries of the Common
            Era; Yoga philosophy became known as one of the six orthodox philosophical schools (Darśanas) of Hinduism in
            the second half of the first millennium CE. Hatha yoga texts began to emerge between the ninth and 11th
            centuries, originating in tantra.

            The term "yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of Hatha yoga and a posture-based physical
            fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique, consisting largely of the asanas; this differs from
            traditional yoga, which focuses on meditation and release from worldly attachments. It was introduced by
            gurus from India after the success of Swami Vivekananda's adaptation of yoga without asanas in the late 19th
            and early 20th centuries. Vivekananda introduced the Yoga Sutras to the West, and they became prominent
            after the 20th-century success of hatha yoga.[26]</b></p>
