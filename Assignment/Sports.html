    <p><b>There was a fascinating moment before the start of play on the first day of the second Test as the England pace
        bowlers marked out their run-ups using an ECB high performance tape measure and Ollie Robinson almost — almost —
        forgot to take it really seriously.

        A carefree first attempt ended in a minor disaster as the end of the tape blew up in the wind. Robinson seemed
        about to walk off absent mindedly at one point. Did he even know the precise millimetre-grade length of his
        run-up, a comfortable thing that brings him rolling up to the crease like a cross channel ferry easing its way
        into dock? Couldn’t he just jog through it a couple of times and drop his cap?
        Except, of course, this was something new. This was Robinson 2.0, the reboot: edges filed down, muscles toned,
        6ft 5in of pale Sussex seamer pressed through the cookie cutter of central contract professionalism.

        Robinson last played a Test eight months, nine matches and three opponents ago. There has been concern in that
        time, the sense of a puzzle to be solved. What is this thing anyway, with its daddish gait, perfect wrist,
        world-class nip and also those entropy-spells where the arm comes over slower and slower, where the action
        becomes a yawn?

        Robinson takes his wickets at 22 in Tests. Robinson gets tired after tea. Robinson was “shamed” over his fitness
        by the bowling coach during an actual live Ashes Test match.

        Sport can be cruel, and also pretty dumb about this kind of stuff. Robinson bowled as many overs as any other
        seamer in Australia, took his wickets at 25, but struggled to sustain the intensity, faded at times when he
        needed to bark at the sun.

        The thing that comes easiest to him is nagging precision. Physical habits, the obsessive self control of the
        modern athlete: this has perhaps been more difficult. For a team that talks a lot about mental health and
        accepting imperfections it did seem a little strange to take such a public, punitive view of his difficulty in
        adapting.

        Robinson stopped bowling for a while after that Ashes tour. Factor in the weirdness of the schedule and this was
        only his second first-class game since the middle of May. It was hard not to see it as a test not just of his
        own commitment, but also of how England have handled this slightly awkward talent, a 28-year-old who looks at
        one moment like a ready-made world-class seam bowler; another like a man dragged out of some Medway clubhouse, a
        scotch egg in one hand, towel around his waist, mumbling about having left his spikes in his mum’s car.</b></p>
